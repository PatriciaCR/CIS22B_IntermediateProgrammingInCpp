Your program will handle a bunch of student test scores - one test score per student - as follows:
1.Use array(s) of student names and test scores - your choice of a 2-D array or parallel arrays.
2.The program will ask the user for the number of scores (for array size), and the names and scores from either a file or user input to - create an input function. scores The student name should be of the format "firstname lastname".  Name and should be accepted on the same line.
3.Maximum 
 of scores should be no more than 1024.
4.Perform proper input validation.
5.Write one or more functions to:
?Determine lowest score of the entire set
?Determine highest score of the entire set
?Calculate mean/average score of the set
?Determine median score of the set, i.e. the score which is greater than half the scores of the set but lower than other half of the scores.
6.Write a function to write formatted output to both screen and an output file.  Your output will print the following for each student:
?A header statistic section of number of scores, lowest, highest, mean and median scores.
?This will be followed by details for each student per line in the same order of names as the input - ?Student Name
?Student Score
?Is student's score the lowest score
?Is student's score the highest score
?Is student's score above or below mean
?Is studen'ts score above or below median

7.Ensure proper prompting and providing useful interactivity to the user.
8.Provide pseudo-code in proper format in the name block of the program as well as needed comments.
9.Upload 3 files:
?Your program file
?Your input format file with data
?Your output file with formatted output.
